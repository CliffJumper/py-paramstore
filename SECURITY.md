## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please go to [Issues](https://github.com/CliffJumper/py-paramstore/issues) and create an issue.
Security issues are given the highest priority over other and existing issues, but it still may take a week or two for them to be addressed, as this is a side-project.
